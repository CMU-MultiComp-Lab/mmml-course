Many of the problems in artificial intelligence, statistics, computer systems, computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, among many other fields, can be viewed as the search for a coherent global conclusion from local information.
The probabilistic graphical models framework provides an unified view for this wide range of problems, enables efficient inference, decision-making and learning in problems with a very large number of attributes and huge datasets.
This graduate-level course will provide you with a strong foundation for both applying graphical models to complex problems and for addressing core research topics in graphical models.
